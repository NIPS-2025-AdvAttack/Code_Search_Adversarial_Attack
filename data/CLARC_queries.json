The function then opens the file specified by the path in binary read mode and proceeds to read its contents in fixed-size chunks. As each chunk is read, it is written to the standard output while simultaneously accumulating the total number of bytes processed. Once the entire file is read, the file is closed, and the function prints the total size of the file data followed by the contents of the provided byte buffer along with its size.

The function processes the input array by sliding a window\u2014with a center offset derived from the filter length\u2014across the data. For each position, it computes two weighted sums: one using the low-pass coefficients to produce an approximation coefficient and the other using the high-pass coefficients to produce a detail coefficient.
